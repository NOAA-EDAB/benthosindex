	abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. “joint species distribution” or “multispecies occupancy” models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed “biogenic habitat”) improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

	abstract = {Diet-based annual biomass indices can potentially use predator stomach contents to provide information about prey biomass and may be particularly useful for species that are otherwise poorly sampled, including ecologically important forage fishes. However, diet-based biomass indices may be sensitive to underlying ecological dynamics between predators and prey, such as predator functional responses and changes in overlap in space and time. To evaluate these factors, we fit spatio-temporal models to stomach contents of five Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) predators and survey catch data for predators and Atlantic herring. We identified drivers of variation in stomach contents, evaluated spatial patterns in stomach content data, and produced predator-specific indices of seasonal Atlantic herring biomass. After controlling for spatio-temporal processes and predator length, diet-based indices of biomass shared similar decadal trends but varied substantially between predators and seasons on shorter time scales. Diet-based indices reflected prey biomass more than prey availability, but weak correlations indicated that not all biological processes were controlled for. Results provide potential guidance for developing diet-based biomass indices and contribute to a body of evidence demonstrating the utility of predator diet data to provide information about relative prey biomass.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

	abstract = {Delta-models (a.k.a. hurdle models) are widely used to fit biomass samples that include zeros and a skewed response for positive catches, and spatio-temporal extensions of these models are increasingly used to quantify trends in abundance (i.e., estimate abundance indices). Previous research has shown estimated indices are proportional to changes in abundance. However, little research has tested the performance of delta-models for estimating “scale”; that is, whether abundance indices are not just proportional to population changes but also have the correct absolute value. We use data for twenty species in the eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska as well as a factorial experiment conditioned on data for Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod to support five conclusions related to scale in spatio-temporal delta-models. First, we show that conventional (nonspatial) delta-models are surprisingly sensitive to the a priori choice of probability distribution for positive catches, where gamma and Tweedie models give similar scale estimates but other distributions generally differ. Second, these same distri­ butions also estimate widely different scales when using spatio-temporal delta-models, and the delta-gamma and Tweedie models provide similar scale to design-based indices. Third, model selection using marginal AIC often identifies the lognormal distribution as most parsimonious, despite it resulting in systematically higher abun­ dance than design-based indices for many species. Fourth, scale is sensitive to the spatial resolution (i.e., number of knots) used in fitting the spatio-temporal model when using a naïve “empirical Bayes” estimator, but less sensitive when applying an epsilon bias-correction estimator. Fifth, the factorial simulation experiment suggests that the Tweedie and delta-gamma distributions perform well even when applied to data simulated from an inverse-Gaussian or lognormal distribution, whereas the opposite is not true. We conclude that index scale is sensitive to delta-model specification, and we make five recommendations when using spatio-temporal deltamodels for index standardization: (1) apply the epsilon or other bias-correction methods to reduce sensitivity of index scale on spatio-temporal model resolution; either (2) compare the scale of delta-model indices with that of design-based indices when design-based indices are available or (3) use the delta-gamma or Tweedie distribution by default when design-based indices are not available; (4) do not assume that AIC will identify the model specification that results in the most appropriate scale; and (5) consider apparent mismatches in index scale depending upon whether an assessment model specifies or estimates the associated catchability coefficient and whether the design-based index is believed to measure total abundance for a fully-selected age or length-class.},

	abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest (“derived quantities”) are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional “plug-in” estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new “epsilon” estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.},

However, identifying climate impacts and sensitive habitats requires integrating spatial heterogeneity and environmental impacts into multispecies models at fine spatial scales. We therefore develop a spatio-temporal model of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments (a “MICE-in-space”), which is fitted to survey sampling data and time series of fishing mortality using maximum-likelihood techniques. The model is implemented in the VAST R package, and it can be configured to range from purely descriptive to including ratio-dependent interactions among species. We demonstrate this model using data for four groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska using data from 1982 to 2015. Model selection for this case-study shows that models with species interactions are parsimonious, although a model specifying separate density dependence without interactions also has substantial support. The AIC-selected model estimates a significant, negative impact of Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) on productivity of other species and suggests that recent fishing mortality for Pacific cod (G. microcephalus, Gadidae) is above the biological reference point (BRP) resulting in 40\% of unfished biomass; other models show similar trends but different scales due to different BRP estimates. A simulation experiment shows that fitting a model with fewer species at a coarse spatial resolution degrades estimation performance, but that interactions and biological reference points can still be estimated accurately. We conclude that MICE-in-space models can simultaneously estimate fishing impacts, species trade-offs, biological reference points and habitat quality. They are therefore suitable to forecast short-term climate impacts, optimize survey designs and designate protected habitats.},

US northeast continental shelf ecosystem, collected from the early 1970s to 2001. Frequency of occurrence of organisms in the diet across time was examined as an index of relative abundance. Other prey and sampling caveats were accounted for by
considering only those predators that met criteria such as adequate sample size, appropriate diet compositions, asymptotic stomach-prey curves, and relative constancy of all major prey groups comprising the diet. The geographic distribution of a suite of
benthic organisms found in the stomachs of predators was also examined. The benthic organisms focused on were ophiuroids, echinoids, holothuroideans, asteroids, octopods, stomatopods, cumaceans, pagurids, aphroditids, anthozoans, hydrozoans and
caprellids. Of these 12 prey groups, only 3 showed a decline over time based on evidence from multiple predator stomachs. Most benthic organisms exhibited non-negative trends in an index of relative abundance, and 2 showed an increase over the
time-series. Additionally, many of the organisms were widely distributed, with some concentrated more on Georges Bank and others more in the Gulf of Maine. Only 1 of 9 organisms showed a shift in distribution compared to studies from 50 yr earlier. I
conclude that at broad spatial and temporal scales, the routine and systematic sampling of fish stomachs can be a useful indirect method for inferring information about benthic communities on continental shelves.},

Here, we investigated the extent to which foundation species may mediate the impacts of disturbance on ecological communities, using the kelp forest ecosystem as a study system. Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) grows rapidly and experiences wave disturbance from winter storms. We developed and analyzed a model of the effects of variable storm regimes on giant kelp population dynamics and of the cascading effects on kelp-mediated competition between benthic community members in kelp forests. Simulations of severe storm regimes resulted in a greater abundance of understory macroalgae and a lower abundance of sessile invertebrates than did milder regimes. Both the cascading effects of periodic loss of giant kelp as well as the degree to which storms directly impacted the benthos (in the form of scouring) influenced the outcome of competition between benthic community members. The model’s qualitative predictions were consistent with empirical data from a 20-yr time series of community dynamics, suggesting that interannual variability in disturbance that affects giant kelp abundance can have strong consequences for benthic community structure. Our findings point to the value of long-term studies in elucidating the interacting effects of disturbance and foundation species.},

This derivation can motivate future theoretical and applied developments.

The assemblage was comprised of 10 statistically significant trophic guilds that were principally differentiated by the relative amounts of Mysida, Bivalvia, Polychaeta, Teleostei and other Crustacea in the diets. These guilds were broadly aggregated into five trophic categories: piscivores, zooplanktivores, benthivores, crustacivores and miscellaneous consumers. Food web structure was largely dictated by gradients in habitat (benthic to pelagic) and prey size. Size classes within piscivorous species were more likely to be classified into different guilds, reflecting stronger dietary changes through ontogeny relative to benthivores and other guilds. Relative to predator species and predator size, the month of sampling had negligible effects on dietary differences within the assemblage. A majority of sampled fishes derived most of their nutrition from non-pelagic prey sources, suggesting a strong coupling of fish production to benthic and demersal food resources. Mysida (predominantly the opossum shrimp Neomysis americana) contributed substantially to the diets of over 25\% of the sampled predator groups, indicating that this species is a critical, but underappreciated, node in the Chesapeake Bay food web.},

This investigation utilized 12 years (2008 to 2019) of fisheries-independent bottom trawl survey data to quantify and synthesize the spatiotemporal patterns of species assemblages inhabiting the nearshore Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB). Assemblages were delineated by ecomorphotype (EMT), and all species collected by the survey were allocated among 9 EMTs: demersal fishes; pelagic fishes; flatfishes; skates; rays; dogfishes; other sharks; cephalopods; and benthic arthropods. Annual time series and seasonal spatial distributions of relative aggregate biomass were quantified for each EMT using delta-generalized additive models. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) revealed that the information content of the 9 annual time series was effectively summarized by 3 common trends, and DFA model fits to each EMT time series represented a new suite of ecosystem indicators for this system. Mean sea surface temperature during winter in the MAB was included in the selected DFA model, suggesting that winter environmental conditions influence the structure of this system at an annual scale. Principal component analysis uncovered a north-to-south gradient in the seasonal spatial distributions of these EMTs and identified a distinct area of elevated biomass for several assemblages along the south shore of Long Island, NY. Taken together, these results characterize the community structure of the nearshore MAB and yield requisite information to support ongoing ecosystem-scale assessment and management activities for this region.},

	abstract = {Multivariate data reduction techniques are widely used to describe modes of variability in atmospheric and oceanographic conditions for the world’s oceans. Dominant modes of variability such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are typically defined as a statistical summary of physical measurements, and include both principle components representing modes of variability over time, and an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) giving the spatial pattern associated with a positive or negative phase for each mode. Typically, these indices are compared with biological conditions to describe or predict physical drivers of ecological dynamics. In some circumstances, however, it may instead be useful to apply EOF analysis directly to biological measurements, estimating indices of biological variability as well as maps of biological response associated with each index. We therefore develop a generalization of EOF analysis that can be applied directly to multispecies biological samples using a multivariate spatio-temporal model. These biologically derived indices can then be compared with relevant indices derived from physical data, or used as covariates in spatially-varying coefficient models. We first show that a spatio-temporal model can replicate previous EOF estimates of the PDO and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. We then identify three axes of variability in the eastern Bering Sea using biomass-sampling data for fourteen bottom-associated fishes and decapod crustaceans from 1982 to 2017. The first axis represents habitat preferences that are stable over time, and the second represents a multi-decadal trend in distribution for most species; for example, showing an increasing density for Alaska skate and arrowtooth flounder in the middle and inner domain. Finally, the third axis shows high interannual variability from 1982 to 1998 switching to multiyear stanzas from 1999 to 2017 and is highly correlated (0.87) with the extent of the cold bottom temperatures in this region and associated impacts on Alaska pollock and Pacific cod. These axes represent ecological dynamics for adult fishes and therefore integrate the impact of bottom-up and top-down processes, and they also confirm the importance of cold-pool extent for fish distribution in the Bering Sea while visualizing its varied impact on individual species. Moreover, this spatio-temporal approach allows oceanographers to define annual indices representing modes of variability in diverse biological communities from widely available field-sampling data.},

	abstract = {Changing distribution and abundance of small pelagic fishes may drive changes in predator distributions, affecting predator availability to fisheries and surveys. However, small pelagics are difficult to survey directly, so we developed a novel method of assessing the aggregate abundance of 21 small pelagic forage taxa via predator stomach contents. We used stomach contents collected from 22 piscivore species captured by multiple bottom trawl surveys within a vector autoregressive spatio-temporal model to assess trends of small pelagics on the Northeast US shelf. The goal was to develop a spatial “forage index” to inform survey and (or) fishery availability in the western North Atlantic bluefish ( Pomatomus saltatrix) stock assessment. This spatially resolved index compared favorably with more traditional design-based survey biomass indices for forage species well sampled by surveys. However, our stomach content-based index better represented smaller unmanaged forage species that surveys are not designed to capture. The stomach-based forage index helped explain bluefish availability to the recreational fishery for stock assessment and provided insight into pelagic forage trends throughout the regional ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Benthic invertebrates support numerous ecosystem functions and services including shellfish production, energy flow to fishes, and biogeochemical cycles. The decline of marine biodiversity worldwide has raised concerns about effects on ecosystems. To examine biodiversity trends of Narragansett Bay over time, a list was compiled of all benthic invertebrate species collected from the bay since 1834. The list covers 104 studies spanning 182 years and currently holds 1214 unique taxa from 21 phyla, the majority of all animal phyla on Earth. A permuted estimator of number of species suggested there are about 300 more yet to be discovered. Widely varying sampling gear and sieve mesh sizes precluded the use of abundance data. Instead, multidimensional scaling and taxonomic distinctness were used with presence-absence data to examine biodiversity trends. The changes in community composition and decline of benthic biodiversity (p {\textless} 0.01) since 1855 are what would be expected of a community that gradually deteriorated in the face of increasing anthropogenic stressors. Taxonomic distinctness had negative correlations (p {\textless} 0.05) with human population in the watershed, total nitrogen inputs, and inputs of metals. This loss of benthic biodiversity has implications for ecosystem functions and services. As some of the stressors waned in the last two or three decades, following passage of environmental legislation in the 1970s, biodiversity appeared to show a partial recovery. An inventory of species, how it has changed over time, and understanding what caused those changes are important for assessing whether remediation programs are achieving improved water quality and ecosystem health.},

	abstract = {One of the main challenges in environmental management is how to manage the dynamics of natural environments. In this context, having information about historical changes of the structure of the biological communities could represent a useful tool to improve management strategies, contributing to refine the policy objectives, since it gives reference states with which to compare the present. The Venice lagoon represents an interesting case study, since it is a highly dynamic, but sensitive, environment which requires the adoption of prudent management. In its recent history the lagoon ecosystem has been exposed to different kinds of disturbance, from the discharge of pollutants and nutrients, to the invasion of alien species and the exploitation of its biological resources by using highly impacting fishing gears. The analysis of available data about the macro-benthic community, from 1935 to 2004, allows the description of changes of the community structure over almost 70 years, showing a sharp decrease in its diversity. In order to obtain information about its functioning, it is necessary to know how these changes have affected processes at the community and system level. In shallow water ecosystems, as the control is mainly due to the benthic compartment, variations in the structure of the benthic community can induce modifications in processes at different hierarchical levels. The trophic structure analysis has revealed major changes during the period; from a well-assorted structure in 1935, to an herbivore–detritivore dominated one in the 1990s, and finally to a filter feeder dominated structure during the last decade. This has produced variations in the secondary production and it has induced modifications in the type of the ecosystem control. These changes are discussed in the light of the dynamics of the main driving forces.},

	abstract = {From the mid-1950's to the mid-1960's a series ofquantitative surveys ofthe macrobenthic
invertebrate fauna were conducted in the offshore New England region (Maine to Long
Island, NewYork) . The surveys were designed to I) obtain measures of macrobenthic
standing crop expressed in terms of density and biomass; 2) determine the taxonomic
composition of the fauna (ca. 567 species); 3) map the general features of macrobenthic
distribution; and 4) evaluate the fauna's relationships to water depth, bottom type, temperature range, and sediment organic carbon content. A total of 1,076 samples, ranging from 3
to 3,974 m in depth, were obtained and analyzed.
The aggregate macrobenthic fauna consists of 44 major taxonomic groups (phyla,
classes, orders). A striking fact is that only five of those groups (belonging to four phyla)
account for over 80\% of both total biomass and number of individuals ofthe macrobenthos.
The five dominant groups are Bivalvia, Annelida, Amphipoda, Echninoidea, and
Holothuroidea.
Other salient features pertaining to the macrobenthos of the region are the following:
substantial differences in quantity exist among different geographic subareas within the
region, but with a general trend that both density and biomass increase from northeast to
southwest; both density and biomass decrease with increasing depth; the composition ofthe
bottom sediments significantly influences both the kind and quantity of macrobenthic
invertebrates, the largest quantities of both measures of abundance occurring in the coarser
grained sediments and diminishing with decreasing particle size; areas with marked seasonal changes in water temperature support an abundant and diverse fauna, whereas a
uniform temperature regime is associated with a sparse, less diverse fauna; and no detectable trends are evident in the quantitative composition of the macrobenthos in relation to
sediment organic carbon content.},

	abstract = {In the early 1960's, a quantitative survey of the macrobenthic invertebrate fauna was conducted in the Middle
Atlantic Bight region. Purposes of this survey were to
obtain a preliminary measure of the macrobenthic standing
crop, particularly of biomass, and secondarily, to determine
the principal taxonomic components of the fauna and the
general features of their distribution. Sampling was conducted at 563 locations; water depths ranged from 4 to
3,080 m. An analysis of f'aunal composition and of quantitative distributions from the survey is presented in this
report. Quantities are expressed in terms of density and
biomass.
Dominant taxonomic components in numbers of individuals
were (in percentage of total fauna): Arthropoda (46),
Mollusca (25), Annelida (21), Echinodermata (4), and
Coelenterata (1). Dominant in biomass were (in percentage
of total fauna): Mollusca (71), Echinodermata (12), Annelida (7), Arthropoda (5), and Ascidiace·a (2). The quantity
of fauna, both density and biomass, decreased substantially
from shallow to deep water. Another major trend was the
marked decrease in quantity from north to south within the
Middle Atlantic Bight. Bottom sediment composition strongly
influenced both the kind and the quantity of macrobenthic
animals. Coarse-grained sediments generally supported the
largest quantities of animals, including many sessile forms.
Fine-grained sediments usually contained a depauperate
fauna; attached organisms were uncommon. No obvious correlations were detected between the amount of organic carbon
in bottom sediments and the quantity of benthic animals
present. Marked seasonal changes in bottom water temperature were associated with an abundant fauna composed of
diverse forms, whereas uniform temperatures throughout the
year were associated with a sparse fauna composed of a
moderate variety of species. Taxonomic groups that were
dominant in a significant number of s·amples, in terms of
number of individuals, were: Bivalvia, Annelida, Echinoidea,
Ophiuroidea, Crustacea, and the bathyal assemblage. Groups
dominant in terms of biomass were: Bivalvia, Annelida,

Most species conforming to expectations are fish and other strong swimmers that can respond to temperature change by migrating as adults. On the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf, however, many benthic invertebrates’ ranges have instead shifted southwards and into shallower, warmer water. We tested whether these ‘wrong-way’ migrations could arise from warming-induced changes in the timing of spawning (phenology) and transport of drifting larvae. The results showed that larvae spawned earlier in the year encounter more downwelling-favourable winds and river discharge that drive transport onshore and southwards. Phenology and transport explained most observed range shifts, whereas climate velocity was a poor predictor. This study reveals a physical mechanism that counterintuitively pushes benthic species, including commercial shellfish, into warmer regions with higher mortality.},
